==========

Online Multiplayer Football Game

The game can be run using the two jars.\r\n
The server needs to be run once, just by the host.\r\n
The client needs to be run by every player (including the host).\r\n
Clients need to enter the server's IP address (visible in the server window).\r\n
\r\n
The game is playable using a minimum of two players, but 4 or more is recommended.\r\n
(Football in 2 teams of 1 isn't very much fun, isn't it ?)\r\n
The game is playable with as much as 11 vs 11 players as well, and IIRC even more.\r\n
\r\n
More clients can be opened from the same PC but playing will be a bit awkward.\r\n
\r\n
Keys are similar to FIFA games:\r\n
\r\n
A: lob(it's more of a strong pass, the game is 2D) / hard tackle (can cause faults)\r\n
S: pass / ask for ball\r\n
D: shot / tackle\r\n
W: sprint (uses energy)\r\n
E: My english isn't good enough to know the word for this - it basically pushes the ball ahead just a bit. Useful for dribling.\r\n
\r\n
Enjoy!\r\n
